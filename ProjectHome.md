# Introduction #
flashgraph provides a set of ActionScript 3 components and classes for quickly parsing and evaluating functions of multiple variables and graphing functions of one variable.

Here are some basic examples of what flashgraph can do:
  * [ExprCalculator](http://flashgraph.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/examples/ExprCalculator/ExprCalculator.swf) is a basic "calculator" that can evaluate functions of 2 variables.
  * [GraphDemo](http://flashgraph.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/examples/GraphDemo/GraphDemo.swf) shows some keyboard and mouse interactions with a graph.
  * [Magnify](http://flashgraph.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/examples/Magnify/Magnify.swf) is an example of a simple educational math applet designed to elucidate the concept of the derivative.


# How do I get it? #
The latest release is available in a downloadable package to the right of this text or on the [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/flashgraph/downloads/list) page.  flashgraph is currently under the GPLv2 license.


# What next? #
The [API documentation](http://flashgraph.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/index.html) is now up (and is also available in the `doc` directory of the distribution).  There is also some tutorial material on the Wiki:
  * GettingStarted contains installation instructions and other preparatory information.
  * ExprExamples has examples of the expression parsing library.
  * GrapherExamples shows some basic uses of the grapher component.

The examples linked to above are included in the distribution in the `examples` folder. Their source should is heavily commented and should prove helpful.

If you run into a problem (which will undoubtedly happen), feel free to drop me a line, leave a comment on the Wiki, or submit an issue.  Please see the FuturePlans page before requesting a feature.
